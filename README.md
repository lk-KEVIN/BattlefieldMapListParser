# BattlefieldMapListParser
A PHP file parser for Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 MapList files

This repository is meant to be used on dedicated BF3/BF4 servers, not EA ones. The idea for making this project come out one day I realized that no one has made anything like this.

## Using
On the [`locations.ini`](locations.ini) you have to place the name and the MapList file location.
On the [`index.php`](index.php) 

## Dependencies
* Bootstrap CSS v4.0.0
* Bootstrap JS v4.0.0
* jQuery v3.3.1

I do love open source so you can use whatever code, style or script you want ðŸ˜Š.
